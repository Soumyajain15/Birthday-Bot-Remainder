## Project Overview

This **Birthday Reminder Bot** is designed to automate the process of sending birthday reminders using **UiPath**. It helps users track upcoming birthdays and sends reminders at configurable intervals, ensuring you never forget to wish a loved one or colleague.

The bot performs the following tasks:
1. Retrieves birthday information from a data source (Excel file, database, or other).
2. Checks if there are any upcoming birthdays within the set number of days.
3. Sends reminder notifications (email, SMS, etc.) a specified number of days before the birthday.
4. Runs automatically at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

## Features

- **Birthday Tracking**: Tracks birthdays from a list stored in an Excel sheet or database.
- **Configurable Reminders**: Set how many days before a birthday the reminder should be sent.
- **Notification Channels**: Supports sending reminders via **email** (SMTP), **Slack**, or **SMS**.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Schedule the bot to run at specific intervals (e.g., every day at 9 AM).
- **Easy to Customize**: Easily modify the bot to adjust reminder dates, notification messages, or delivery methods.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **UiPath Studio**: Ensure you have **UiPath Studio** installed. You can download it from the [UiPath website](https://www.uipath.com/start-trial).
   
2. **UiPath Robot**: The bot needs to be executed by **UiPath Robot**. Ensure it's installed and set up.

3. **Email or Notification Platform**:
   - **Email**: If you plan to send reminders via email, configure an SMTP server (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).
   - **Slack**: If using Slack for notifications, create a Slack app and configure the webhook URL.
   - **SMS**: Set up an SMS service (e.g., Twilio) and retrieve your API keys.

4. **Excel or Database**: 
   - An **Excel file** or a **database** containing birthday details (name, date, email, etc.) is required to store contact information.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/birthday-reminder-bot-uipath.git
